# Multiplication Land 🧙✨

An RPG-style math game where you walk around a field, encounter cute monsters, and catch them by solving multiplication problems!

## How to Play

1. **Choose your mode** on the start screen:
   - **Multiply By 5's** — Practice 1×5 through 12×5
   - **Multiply By 6's** — Practice 1×6 through 12×6

2. **Explore the field** using Arrow Keys or WASD.

3. **Random encounters** — Cute monsters appear as you walk! Solve the math problem to deal damage. Correct answers use your attack power to weaken them.
